# Drowsiness-Detection-System

Overview

This repository presents an advanced drowsiness detection system based on the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) algorithm. The primary goal of this project is to enhance road safety by alerting drivers in real-time when signs of drowsiness are detected, thereby preventing potential accidents caused by driver fatigue.

YOLOv5 Algorithm

YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, known for its speed and accuracy. It enables real-time detection of multiple objects, including facial landmarks and features crucial for identifying drowsiness in drivers.

Dataset

To train and evaluate the drowsiness detection model, we curated a comprehensive dataset containing images and corresponding labels indicating the presence of drowsiness in drivers. The dataset has been carefully annotated to ensure accurate training and reliable performance.
